# Custom Starting Items

## About:

This mod restores disabled feature from the older Sample Versions which used to let you select your own set of starting items.

Original menu used to give option to select two potions instead of items - however, that feature has been broken over time between scrapping of this menu and the game's release. 
While partially functional, it would give you potions as items instead. Later FP2 updates replaced the potion preview with information about automatically applied Assist settings.

This mod replaces these two potions with items, as well as fixes wrong icons for some of them. The original menu was made only with older items in mind, and requires further patching to display items added later.
